Name_for_CITESdb - The species taxonomic name in the CITES trade data.
WildSource - Is the trade wildsourced. See methods for exact definitions of this.
IUCN_code - Time calibrated IUCN statuses
Threat_code - IUCN codes converted into non-threatened, threatened and not assessed.
Age_at_first_breeding - sourced from Bird et al. 2020
Max_longevity - sourced from Bird et al. 2020
Bodymass - sourced from Bird et al. 2020
WildSourceB - a logical variable for source.
WildThreat - a combined variable of source and threat. First letter denotes source (W = Wild, C = Captive), second part denotes threat (NA = Not assessed, NT = Non threatened, T = Threatened)
Traded_vol - volume the species was traded in from that source that year. If no trade occured but it was a year the species was listed and therefore could have been recorded in trade its 0.
lagN - 1-year lagged values of trade volume.
SLogMaxlongevity - Logged and standardised Max_longevity. 
SLogBodymass - Logged and standardised Bodymass.
SLogFirstRepro - Logged and standardised Age_at_first_breeding.
LogMaxlongevity - Logged Max_longevity. 
LogBodymass - Logged Bodymass.
LogFirstRepro - Logged Age_at_first_breeding.
SYear - standardised Year
Group - unique identifiers for each species and source combination.
Name_for_phylo - taxonomic name used to match to the Jetz et al. phylogeny.
